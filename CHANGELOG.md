2. Serve prometheus metrics file using any web server (name it index.html to be the default page in configured path)
3. Configure prometheus target to access the file
4. Add Prometheus datasource in Grafana
5. Import grafana_en/pl.json file (Dashboards->Manage->Import).

To use InfluxDB support:
1. Install InfluxDB
2. Create database to store data (i.e: create database Data)
3. Configure InfluxDB options in config.cfg
4. Add InfluxDB datasource in Grafana (name it InfluxDB)

## [1.21] - 2021-10-21
To upgrade overwrite all previous project files.

### Added

### Changed
1. Prometheus integration code (write to a file all data at once).
2. Script writes values to InfluxDB/Promtheus/MQTT only if inverter status is Normal.
   In other states values can be unreliable - especially when inverter is starting in the morning.
3. Grafana dashboard for InfluxDB datasource was changed and fixed in a few places.

### Fixed

## [1.3] - 2021-10-23
To upgrade overwrite all previous project files.

### Added
1. New script to read hardware/software/SN info from inverter.
   Two new files: InverterHWData.py (main script) and SOFARHWMap.xml (register configuration)

### Changed

### Fixed

## [1.4] - 2021-10-28
A few additions and changes.

### Added
1. New parameters in config.cfg to define register address ranges
2. Checking if logger response is correct (no empty values for defined registers). If not - report end exit.

### Changed
1. config.cfg format has slightly changed

### Fixed

## [1.5] - 2021-11-02
MQTT support refactored and fixed

### Added
1. New parameters in config.cfg for MQTT integration
2. MQTT TLS support

### Changed
1. Always output data in JSON format (no matter if MQTT is enabled or not)

### Fixed
MQTT support (tested with Mosquitto)

## [1.6] - 2021-11-23
Domoticz MQTT support

### Added
1. New parameter in config.cfg to enable Domoticz MQTT support
2. DomoticzIdx parameter in SOFARMAP.xml

### Changed
1. Removed unused parserRule parameter from SOFARMap.xml

### Fixed

## [1.61] - 2021-11-23
Fix version

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
1. Small fix for duplicated quotes for string values in MQTT Domoticz messages.

## [1.66] - 2022-02-22
Fix version

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
1. Reliable messages delivery to MQTT/Domoticz. 

## [1.7] - 2022-02-23
HomeAssistant support

### Added
1. Home Assistant support (via MQTT) - code courtesy of @pablolite

### Changed
1. Minor cleanups.

### Fixed
## [1.8] - 2022-02-24
MQTT support (including Domoticz/HomeAssistant) refactored

### Added
1. Sending inverter's status to MQTT/Domoticz/HomeAssistant when the device is turned off.

### Changed
1. Basic MQTT message output as a separate option (independent from Domoticz or HomeAssistant support)
2. Dedicated MQTT topic settings for basic support, Domoticz and HomeAssistant
3. Additional parameters in config.cfg for above changes

### Fixed

## [1.82] - 2022-02-25
Fixes, code refactoring and clean-ups

### Added
1. Logger connecting messages in verbose mode

### Changed
1. Some code refactoring and unnecesarry parts removal

### Fixed
1. Sending offline status to MQTT (basic, Domoticz, HomeAssistant)

## [1.83] - 2022-03-01
Fix

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
1. Small fix for potential charmap_decode error (especially in Windows environment)

## [1.84] - 2022-04-29
Report 0 if logger/inverter is offline

### Added

### Changed
Now script writes 0 to InfluxDB for all monitored parameters if logger/inverter is offline
It helps getting more acurate data agregations (i.e. in Grafana)

### Fixed

## [1.9] - 2023-09-21
Fixes, additional file and debug logging, ~~InfluxDB v2.x support~~

### Added
1. Logfile configuration in config.cfg
2. Additional debug option in config.cfg - enables additional debug info written to a log file

### Changed
1. ~~InfluxDB support now requires InfluxDB v2.x (instead of 1.x).~~
2. ~~InfluxDB config section in config.cfg to reflect InfluxDB v2.x access requirements~~

### Fixed
1. Endless data gathering loop when inverter's status <> 0 (ready), that flooded logger and made it hang. That fixes issue #46

## [1.9b] - 2024-07-17
Forked version with kept InfluxDB v1.x support, some minor tweaks.

### Changed
1. Retrieved InfluxDB v1.x support from release 1.84
2. Specified callbackAPI to V2 due to breaking changes in paho-mqtt 2.0+
3. Increased MQTT timeout to 10s to avoid rare connection breaking.
